# BhoomiSetu - MERN Responsive Starter

This archive contains a minimal MERN scaffold (backend + frontend). Frontend is a Vite + React skeleton; backend is Express + Mongoose.

## Run backend
- cd backend
- npm install
- create .env from .env.example
- npm run dev

## Run frontend
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm run start

Notes: For full Tailwind styling, install and configure Tailwind in the frontend (tailwind.config.js, postcss). This scaffold includes core functionality and a demo UI.

If you uploaded a `frontbhoomii.zip`, it has been merged under `frontend/uploaded/` in this package (if present).
